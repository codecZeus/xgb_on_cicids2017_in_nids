I hereby acknowledge that the research reported in this dissertation has been carried out with the responsible and ethical utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. AI tools such as ChatGPT- 4 and Gemini were utilized to assist in specific tasks, including:


\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Language and Grammar Assistance:} AI-based writing assistants were used to enhance the clarity and coherence of the text, ensuring proper grammar and style.
    \item \textbf{Learning:} AI-powered resources were instrumental in my learning process, helping me to clarify complex concepts, test my understanding through interactive questioning, and explore related research areas.
\end{itemize}


\noindent However, it is important to emphasize that the core ideas, research design, results, interpretations, and conclusions presented in this thesis are solely the product of my own intellectual effort. AI served as a supportive tool, not a substitute for critical thinking and independent research.\\

\noindent I acknowledge the limitations of AI and the potential for biases within its algorithms. Therefore, I have carefully reviewed and validated all AI-generated outputs to ensure their accuracy and alignment with the research objectives.\\

\noindent I accept complete accountability for the material presented in this thesis and assert that it complies with the utmost standards of academic integrity and ethical research practices.
