It is a requirement of the University that you complete an online ethics form. You should discuss the ethical implications of your project in your dissertation. Even if your project has no ethical implications, you should make this clear in your report. In this section, you must include the date your project received ethical approval. You must also include a copy of your projectâ€™s ethical clearance confirmation in the appendices.
