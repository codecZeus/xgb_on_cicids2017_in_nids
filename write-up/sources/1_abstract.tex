\begin{abstract}
    An abstract is a brief summary of your dissertation.
    Not all institutions require this component, so check on whether it is required and any guidelines on what is required.
    Journal articles usually have abstracts, so you can draw on these for guidance on how to approach this task.
    Abstracts in modern journals (especially e-journals) are often accompanied by keywords which can act as a useful guide in constructing searches for your literature.
