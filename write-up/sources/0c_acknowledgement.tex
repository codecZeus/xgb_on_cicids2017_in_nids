I would first like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Sidhu Selvarajan. Your consistent encouragement, constructive feedback, and deep expertise in the subject matter were invaluable in the research and writing of this thesis. Your guidance has been a great source of support and inspiration for me throughout the process. 

I am also very grateful to the open-source community. In particular, the development of Python as well as the community-developed libraries NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and XGBoost. Without their powerful and free toolkits, the statistical analysis and modeling efforts in this thesis could not have been done.

 I would also like to thank the team behind the CIC-IDS2017 dataset. Their commitment to developing and sharing a high-quality and comprehensive intrusion detection dataset was crucial for the empirical analysis in this thesis. Without it, this research would not have been possible. 
 
 Finally, I would like to thank the various online platforms for providing me with the essential tools for conducting and documenting this research. In particular, the free account for Overleaf was extremely helpful for writing and storing this thesis in \LaTeX, while GitHub provided a reliable and user-friendly platform for version control and secure storage of all my code and write-ups. 
 
 I am also thankful to my family and friends for their support and patience. I could not have done it without you, and this success is as much yours as it is mine.
